## Gift Exchange

Script to assign participants in a gift exchange.

Accepts an arbitrary number of participants and assigns them randomly. The first
two names in the list of participants are considered organizers. The script will
create files for each organizer to read, keeping assignments related to each
organizer a secret!  Organizers will never be assigned to each other.
